After using all three editors Emacs, Nano, and Vi, I would say that Emacs is my favorite.  Initially I have picked Nano because from the user screen I thought it is easier to use than the other twos.  However, after using these three I found emacs to be more easier to use.  The commands on emacs are easier for me to use and navigate compare to the other two.  On Nano I have to keep exit and comeback when I open a new file.  On Vi I am keep having trouble with some of the commands when I try to edit a file.  But overall it was a struggle for all three and take me a long time to complete this assignment, I just need to spend more time practicing so that I can be better.
